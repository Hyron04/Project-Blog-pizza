          Slice of Delight: Exploring the World Through Pizzas
        </h1>
        <section class="content">
          <h2>The Origin of the Pizza</h2>
          <p>
            The origin of pizza traces back to ancient civilizations like the
            Greeks, Egyptians, and Romans, who ate flatbreads with various
            toppings.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the pizza as we know it today—with a dough base, tomato
            sauce, and cheese—originated in Naples, Italy, in the late 18th to
            early 19th century. Initially, pizza was a dish for poor people,
            sold in the streets and not considered a kitchen recipe.
          </p>
          <p>
            It gained fame with the creation of the Margherita Pizza, which was
            named in honor of Queen Margherita of Savoy after her visit to
            Naples in 1889. The pizza was garnished with tomatoes, mozzarella
            cheese, and basil to represent the colors of the Italian flag. This
            event significantly boosted the dish's popularity, making it a
            symbol of Italian cuisine and later a global staple.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            You don't have to cook fancy or complicated masterpieces—just good
            food from fresh ingredients. And pizza certainly fits the bill,
            being both simple and delightful.
            <p><cite> Julia Child </cite></p>

          <h2>Different Pizzas</h2>
          <p>
            Pizzas, with their rich history and endless variations, offer a
            delicious exploration of global and regional tastes. Here’s a look
            at some distinct and popular types of pizzas from around the world:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="bolded">Neapolitan Pizza (Naples, Italy):</span> This
              is where pizza originated. Neapolitan pizza is known for its
              simple ingredients: a basic dough, raw tomatoes, fresh mozzarella
              cheese, fresh basil, and olive oil. No fancy toppings are allowed
              here; the charm is in the freshness and quality of the
              ingredients, baked in a wood-fired oven that gives it a unique,
              charred flavor that's hard to replicate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bolded">New York Style Pizza (USA):</span> Known for
              its large, foldable slices and crispy outer crust, New York-style
              pizza is made with a high-gluten bread flour and features a layer
              of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. It’s often sold by the
              slice to suit the fast-paced lifestyle of New Yorkers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bolded">Chicago Deep Dish Pizza (USA):</span> Unlike
              the thin crust of Neapolitan or New York-style pizzas, the Chicago
              deep dish is baked in a round, steel pan that gives it high edges.
              The toppings are layered in reverse, with slices of mozzarella
              lining the dough followed by meat, vegetables, and then canned
              tomato sauce on top. This pizza is quite hearty and thick,
              resembling more of a pie than a flatbread.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bolded">Sicilian Pizza (Sicily, Italy):</span>
              Sicilian pizza, or "sfincione," features a thick crust and is
              traditionally topped with tomato sauce, onions, anchovies, and
              herbs. Over in the United States, the Sicilian style is often
              synonymous with a square-cut pizza that has a thick crust.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bolded">Detroit Style Pizza (USA):</span>
              Characterized by its square shape and thick deep-dish crust which
              is crispy and chewy, Detroit-style pizza is unique because of its
              reverse topping style similar to Chicago deep dish. Traditionally,
              it’s topped with pepperoni, followed by brick cheese which goes
              all the way to the edges, creating a caramelized cheese border.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bolded">Roman Pizza (Rome, Italy):</span> Roman
              pizzas come in two main types: pizza al taglio (by the slice)
              which is rectangular and served with a variety of toppings, and
              pizza Romana, a thinner, crispier but slightly softer than the
              Neapolitan version. Both are distinguished by their crust, which
              is airy and bubbly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bolded">Calzone (Italy):</span> Though not
              technically a pizza, it’s worth mentioning as it uses pizza dough.
              Calzones are crescent moon-shaped dough filled with the
              ingredients typically found on pizzas. The contents are enclosed
              entirely in the dough and it's either baked or fried, making it a
              delicious and portable meal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bolded">Hawaiian Pizza (Canada):</span> Despite its
              name, Hawaiian pizza was actually invented by a Canadian. It’s a
              standard pizza topped with cheese, ham, and pineapple, and it
              creates a controversial but popular sweet and savory flavor
              combination among pizza enthusiasts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bolded">Indian Pizza:</span> In India, local flavors
              make the pizza truly unique. Toppings might include tandoori
              chicken or paneer, and pickled ginger, with sauces that can range
              from traditional tomato to spicy masala. These pizzas are a fusion
              of Italian technique with Indian flavors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bolded">Korean Pizza (South Korea):</span> Korean
              pizza is often loaded with unique toppings that might include
              corn, sweet potato mousse, bulgogi (Korean BBQ beef), and even
              seafood such as shrimp or squid. It's a real departure from
              traditional Italian pizza, showcasing the playful and innovative
              nature of Korean cuisine.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These variations not only show the versatility of pizza but also how
            different cultures have embraced and personalized this beloved dish.
            Whether it’s the simplicity of a Margherita or the complexity of a
            Korean pizza, there’s a style to suit every palate.
